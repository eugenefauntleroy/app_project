# One-Stop Travel Assistance App

This project is a work-in-progress application designed to provide a comprehensive travel assistance experience. It integrates several technologies including Node.js, Express.js, SQL, Mailchimp, OpenAI GPT-3, Zendesk, React, and Firebase.

## Project Structure

The main files in this project are:

- `backend.js`: Sets up a Node.js/Express.js server, connects to a SQL database, and integrates with Mailchimp CRM.
- `gpt3_chatbot_example.py`: Uses the OpenAI GPT-3 model to generate a response to a given prompt.
- `display_and_backend_draft.jsx`: A React component that fetches and displays a list of properties from a backend API.
- `gpt_to_zendesk.py`: Uses the OpenAI GPT-3 model to generate a response to a given prompt and creates a new ticket in Zendesk if the question is not answered.
- `login.jsx`: A React component for a login form that uses Firebase for user authentication.
- `itinerary_template_square.js`: Contains two React components for displaying and adding itinerary items.
- `script.js`: Imports functions from the other files and uses them to create a basic layout for a travel website.

## Current Features

- **Itinerary Creation**: Users can create their own itineraries.
- **GPT-3 Chatbot**: Users can chat with a GPT-3 powered chatbot for travel advice.
- **Email Subscription**: Users can subscribe to a mailing list via Mailchimp.

- Integration with more travel-related APIs for flight and hotel data.
- More advanced chatbot capabilities.
- User profiles and the ability to save itineraries.

## Possible Use Cases

While this project is currently focused on travel assistance, the technologies and functions used could be adapted for other use cases, such as:

- **Real Estate Platform**: The property listing and filtering functionality could be expanded for a real estate platform.
- **Customer Support for Various Industries**: The integration with GPT-3 and Zendesk could be used for customer support in various industries.
- **Event Planning**: The itinerary creation feature could be adapted for planning events.
- **E-Learning Platform**: The project could be used as an educational tool for learning about various technologies.
